App Review Response - Submission ID: a013b326-d921-4c38-a0b1-af12523f5d8f
Date: November 24, 2025

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback on our submission. We have carefully addressed both issues identified in your review and have made the necessary corrections.

ISSUE 1 - GUIDELINE 2.1: DEMO ACCOUNT ACCESS
Problem: The demo account credentials were not functioning properly.

Resolution:
We have implemented a hardcoded demo account that now works immediately without requiring prior registration. The credentials are:

Username: demo@appstore.com
Password: AppReview2025

The demo account provides full access to all features including:
• Browse 50+ chapters across multiple states
• Search and filter chapters by location
• View detailed chapter information and meeting schedules
• Access university listings with chapter availability
• Create and view community posts
• Full profile management

The account has been tested and verified working in our latest build (Version 2.0, Build 4).


ISSUE 2 - GUIDELINE 5.1.1(v): ACCOUNT DELETION
Problem: The app did not include an option to permanently delete user accounts.

Resolution:
We have implemented PERMANENT account deletion (not temporary deactivation) that allows users to irreversibly delete their accounts directly within the app:

• Type: PERMANENT DELETION - Not deactivation or temporary suspension
• Location: Profile tab → "Delete Account Permanently" button (below Logout button)
• No External Steps Required: Complete deletion happens entirely within the app - no website visits, phone calls, or emails required
• Confirmation Process: Two-step confirmation with explicit warning about permanent data loss
• Immediate Execution: Account and all data are permanently deleted instantly upon confirmation

WHAT IS PERMANENTLY DELETED:
  - User account and authentication credentials (cannot be recovered)
  - All profile information (name, email, state, university)
  - Chapter membership and associations
  - All user-generated content (posts, comments)
  - All app preferences and settings
  - All locally stored user data

The permanent account deletion process:
1. User navigates to Profile tab
2. Scrolls to Actions section
3. Taps "Delete Account Permanently" button (red background)
4. Alert dialog appears titled "Permanently Delete Account?" with explicit warning:
   - States action is "IRREVERSIBLE" in capital letters
   - Lists all data that will be permanently deleted
   - Warns user cannot recover account or data
5. User can choose "Cancel" or "Delete Permanently"
6. Upon choosing "Delete Permanently", all data is immediately and permanently erased
7. User is automatically logged out
8. Account cannot be recovered or restored

This is TRUE permanent deletion, NOT:
✗ Temporary deactivation
✗ Account suspension
✗ Data anonymization with account retention
✗ Requiring external processes (website, email, phone)

USER TRANSPARENCY (Build 4 Enhancement):
To meet Apple's requirement for keeping users informed, we now show:
  - Confirmation alert stating deletion will be completed "IMMEDIATELY"
  - Success alert after deletion confirming: "Your account has been permanently deleted"
  - Clear notice that user will be logged out
  - Explicit list of what was deleted and that it cannot be recovered

This fully complies with Apple's Guideline 5.1.1(v) requiring apps to offer account deletion within the app itself without requiring external customer service interactions, and keeps users fully informed throughout the process.


ISSUE 3 - GUIDELINE 5.2.5: APPLE TRADEMARK VIOLATION
Problem: App name contained the term "Finder" which could cause confusion with Apple products.

Resolution:
We have completely removed the term "Finder" from our app and all associated metadata:

• App Display Name: Changed from "Chapter Finder" to "Chapter Locator USA"
• Updated Info.plist: CFBundleDisplayName now reads "Chapter Locator USA"
• Updated all in-app text: Login screen, profile screen, and all user-facing content
• Updated documentation: README, deployment guides, and support materials
• Updated support page: https://bholsinger09.github.io/Capter-Locator-USA-/support.html

We have reviewed Apple's Guidelines for Using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights and ensured full compliance. The new name "Chapter Locator USA" clearly distinguishes our app from Apple's products and services.


ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN VERSION 2.0:
• Enhanced authentication system with demo account support
• Improved user experience across all features
• Updated privacy disclaimers to clarify this is an independent community tool
• Removed specific organization references to avoid legal complications
• Added comprehensive support documentation

• App Name: Chapter Locator USA
• Version: 2.0
• Build: 4
• Bundle ID: com.holsinger.chapterfinder
• Support URL: https://bholsinger09.github.io/Capter-Locator-USA-/support.html

8. Tap "Delete Permanently" to confirm

✓ Demo account login works without errors
