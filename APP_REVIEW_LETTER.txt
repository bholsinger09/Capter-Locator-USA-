App Review Response - Submission ID: a013b326-d921-4c38-a0b1-af12523f5d8f
Date: November 24, 2025

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback on our submission. We have carefully addressed both issues identified in your review and have made the necessary corrections.

ISSUE 1 - GUIDELINE 2.1: DEMO ACCOUNT ACCESS
Problem: The demo account credentials were not functioning properly.

Resolution:
We have implemented a hardcoded demo account that now works immediately without requiring prior registration. The credentials are:

Username: demo@appstore.com
Password: AppReview2025

The demo account provides full access to all features including:
• Browse 50+ chapters across multiple states
• Search and filter chapters by location
• View detailed chapter information and meeting schedules
• Access university listings with chapter availability
• Create and view community posts
• Full profile management

The account has been tested and verified working in our latest build (Version 2.0, Build 2).


ISSUE 2 - GUIDELINE 5.1.1(v): ACCOUNT DELETION
Problem: The app did not include an option to delete user accounts.

Resolution:
We have added a comprehensive account deletion feature that allows users to permanently delete their accounts:

• Location: Profile tab → "Delete Account" button (below Logout)
• Confirmation: Users must confirm deletion through a native iOS alert dialog
• Warning Message: Clear notice that deletion is permanent and irreversible
• Data Removal: All user data is permanently deleted including:
  - Profile information (name, email, state, university)
  - Account credentials
  - Chapter membership
  - User-created posts and content
  - All locally stored user data

The account deletion process:
1. User taps "Delete Account" button in Profile
2. Alert appears with warning about permanent data loss
3. User can cancel or confirm deletion
4. Upon confirmation, all data is immediately deleted
5. User is logged out automatically

This feature complies with Apple's requirement for apps that support account creation to also offer account deletion.


ISSUE 3 - GUIDELINE 5.2.5: APPLE TRADEMARK VIOLATION
Problem: App name contained the term "Finder" which could cause confusion with Apple products.

Resolution:
We have completely removed the term "Finder" from our app and all associated metadata:

• App Display Name: Changed from "Chapter Finder" to "Chapter Locator USA"
• Updated Info.plist: CFBundleDisplayName now reads "Chapter Locator USA"
• Updated all in-app text: Login screen, profile screen, and all user-facing content
• Updated documentation: README, deployment guides, and support materials
• Updated support page: https://bholsinger09.github.io/Capter-Locator-USA-/support.html

We have reviewed Apple's Guidelines for Using Apple's Trademarks and Copyrights and ensured full compliance. The new name "Chapter Locator USA" clearly distinguishes our app from Apple's products and services.


ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN VERSION 2.0:
• Enhanced authentication system with demo account support
• Improved user experience across all features
• Updated privacy disclaimers to clarify this is an independent community tool
• Removed specific organization references to avoid legal complications
• Added comprehensive support documentation
